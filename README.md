# Face Recognition

This is an assignment that I have done during a deeplearning online course in CNN from coursera(deeplearning.ai). 

In this assignment, I will build a face recognition system. Many of the ideas presented here are from [FaceNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832.pdf). [DeepFace](https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/deepface-closing-the-gap-to-human-level-performance-in-face-verification.pdf). 

Face recognition problems commonly fall into two categories: 

- **Face Verification** - "is this the claimed person?". For example, at some airports, you can pass through customs by letting a system scan your passport and then verifying that you (the person carrying the passport) are the correct person. A mobile phone that unlocks using your face is also using face verification. This is a 1:1 matching problem. 
- **Face Recognition** - "who is this person?". This is a 1:K matching problem. 

FaceNet learns a neural network that encodes a face image into a vector of 128 numbers. By comparing two such vectors, you can then determine if two pictures are of the same person.
    
**In this assignment, I will:**
- Implement the triplet loss function
- Use a pretrained model to map face images into 128-dimensional encodings
- Use these encodings to perform face verification and face recognition

#### Channels-first notation

* In this assignment, I will be using a pre-trained model which represents ConvNet activations using a **"channels first"** convention, as opposed to the "channels last" . 
* In other words, a batch of images will be of shape $(m, n_C, n_H, n_W)$ instead of $(m, n_H, n_W, n_C)$. 
* Both of these conventions have a reasonable amount of traction among open-source implementations; there isn't a uniform standard yet within the deep learning community. 

## 0 - Naive Face Verification

In Face Verification, given two images and we have to determine if they are of the same person. The simplest way to do this is to compare the two images pixel-by-pixel. If the distance between the raw images are less than a chosen threshold, it may be the same person!
